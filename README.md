Game Name: Rock Paper Scissors

The project that me and my group decided on doing is (Rock, Paper, Scissors) this minigame involves the user to compete with the server in a game of Rock, Paper, Scissor and the best of 3 wins. the game will start with a menu page where the user will be able to select the difficulties that fits him/her there will be three buttons that will lead to different levels (Easy, Normal, Hard) once the user enters the level then the game starts by displaying three images/symbols in the middle of the screen, the score of the user on the top left of the screen and computer score will be on the top right of the screen. The user must select an image/symbol Then the chosen shape is going to be compared randomly by the computer. At the end of every round, the name of the winner will appear at the buttom of the page and the score will be recalculated with new values coresponding to the results of the round. the format for this competition is “best of three”, for a user to win this challenge must win 3 rounds. at the end of the game there will be two buttons that the user can pick from, the first button is "restart" which allows the user to play again with the same difficulty. the second button is "menu" which takes the user back to the main menu where he/she can pick another dificulty to play against.

•	The name of the game will be displayed on the top of the main menu.    
•	The program will have the main menu in which users can see the rules of the game.    
•	The start menu consists of difficulty levels in which the player will choose.

•	The server will display the winner of each round after the round finishes the winner of the round will be displayed at the bottom of the page    
•	The user will be competing in the format of “best of three”, which the winner will be displayed at the end of the competition.
